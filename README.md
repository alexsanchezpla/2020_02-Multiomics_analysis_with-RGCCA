# 2020_02-Multiomics_analysis_with-RGCCA

This repo contains some examples of how to analyze muti-omics data using the the RGCCA package.

This package implements the RGCCA and SGCCA methods developed by Tennenhaus et alt. (2011).

In a recent paper Garali (2017) suggests a strategy for multimodal data integration based on the application of SCGGA. We will attempt to illustrate (to see) this strategy.

Many papers of this group are based on a dataset that is not  public yet, the SCA dataset. THis makes it more difficult to reproduce their examples so what I will do will be to rely on the RGCCA package vignette and try to find out if the suggested strategy can be visuaklized in it.
